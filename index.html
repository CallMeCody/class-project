            <p>Ohana (family) is deeply important in Hawaiian culture, which makes our islands a welcoming destination
                for kids of all ages. From snorkeling and sandcastle building on sun-soaked beaches to exploring
                volcanoes and sacred cultural sites, the
                Hawaiian Islands are a natural playground you never outgrow. Hawaii is literally swimming with
                water-based activities. Kids can pet a sea lion at Sea Life Park, learn to surf from a pro on Waikiki
                Beach, and see massive humpback whales
                splashing around during a whale-watching tour on Maui, Molokai or Lanai. Snorkeling is a kid-approved
                activity all year long; popular spots include the shallow, protected tide pools of Poipu Beach on Kauai
                and the island of Hawaii’s Kona
                coast, where you can even swim with dolphins and manta rays.</p>

            <p>Home to the world’s most active volcanoes, the only royal palace in the U.S. and the welcoming aloha
                spirit—Hawaii is like no place on earth. Discover the glimmering ocean, emerald valleys and golden
                sands; get lost in the spiritual beauty
                of the hula and find out how the warmth of Hawaii’s people wonderfully complement the islands’ perfect
                temperatures. We invite you to explore the Islands of Aloha to find your own heavenly Hawaii
                experiences. Aloha.

            <p>Keep your camera ready: in Hawaii, breathtaking sights await you around every turn. Here, just about
                every byway is scenic, and each overlook offers a new Instagram-ready vista. From hidden sea caves along
                the Napali Coast to state parks that
                let you walk in the footsteps of Hawaiian royalty—not to mention our hundreds of miles of sun-kissed
                beaches—we invite you to explore Hawaii's magnificent scenery.
